(CDEs)","description":"When you are looking to add deep blockchain integration to your game, you will likely be interested in accessing information about ownership of ERC721s (NFTs) or a wallet\'s balance of ERC20 tokens for example. Paima Engine enables this by automatically doing the heavy work for you via a feature called Chain Data Extensions. CDEs allow you to read data trustlessly from multiple locations such as the underlying L1.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Reacting to Events/Funnel Types/Block Funnel":{"id":"home/Reacting to Events/Funnel Types/Block Funnel","title":"Block Funnel","description":"Block funnel is the most standard funnel type in Paima. It simply downloads the blocks from the RPC provider for the chain you are deploying to.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Reacting to Events/Funnel Types/Intro":{"id":"home/Reacting to Events/Funnel Types/Intro","title":"Paima Funnel","description":"A core library which allows a consumer to initialize a chain funnel object which holds state regarding:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Reacting to Events/Funnel Types/Stable Tick Funnel":{"id":"home/Reacting to Events/Funnel Types/Stable Tick Funnel","title":"Stable Tick Rate","description":"Not every blockchain has a predictable block time. This is especially true of L2s like Arbitrum that only create batches when there is at least 1 transaction to post to the L1","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Reacting to Events/L2-quirks":{"id":"home/Reacting to Events/L2-quirks","title":"L2 Quirks","description":"L2s often have different definitions for certain fields inside blocks. If you are deploying a game with Paima on top of one of these L2s, you need to understand the meaning of these values to avoid tipfalls. To facilitate these, we\'ve generated a table of the meaning of these values for the most commons L2s.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Reacting to Events/scheduled-events":{"id":"home/Reacting to Events/scheduled-events","title":"Scheduling Events and Timers","description":"Games heavily rely on passive time to trigger events, such as limits on the length of a match or the duration of status effects. Paima supports these through a generic system called scheduledData that keeps track of which inputs (that conform to your app\'s grammar) to trigger at which block height (used instead of timestamps).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Read & Write L2 State/autosign":{"id":"home/Read & Write L2 State/autosign","title":"Auto-signing for apps","description":"Note: wallets that use this feature are still in development","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Read & Write L2 State/base-format":{"id":"home/Read & Write L2 State/base-format","title":"Read and Write to L2 state","description":"To be a rollup, Paima state has to eventually be written to the L1. As a sovereign rollup, the way the data is stored is fairly simple (calling a contract function that simply emits its input as an event) and we provide a way to generate a grammar for this data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Read & Write L2 State/batched-mode":{"id":"home/Read & Write L2 State/batched-mode","title":"Batched mode","description":"Paima supports two different modes for inputs:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Read & Write L2 State/error-handling":{"id":"home/Read & Write L2 State/error-handling","title":"Error Handling","description":"Errors are unavoidable.

This is powerful as it allows different matches played by different players to be run in parallel. However, moves by players in the same lobby need to be made sequential.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Read & Write L2 State/posting-test-game-inputs":{"id":"home/Read & Write L2 State/posting-test-game-inputs","title":"Posting Test Game Inputs To L2 Contract","description":"Once you have the Paima L2 contract deployed for your game together with your game node up and running, you will inevitably want to test sending game inputs to the blockchain","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Read & Write L2 State/replay-protection":{"id":"home/Read & Write L2 State/replay-protection","title":"Replay protection","description":"Given that games made with Paima Engine are technically \\"open\\" (meaning anyone can submit valid game input), one thing which we need to look out for is replaying attacks. Replaying attacks are situations classically in blockchains (but liable to any openly accessible state machine) where a previous valid input is resubmitted to the state machine/blockchain. Usually this is done by bad actors, and can cause various issues.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Setting Up Your Environment/deploying-l2-smart-contract":{"id":"home/Setting Up Your Environment/deploying-l2-smart-contract","title":"Deploying The Paima L2 Smart Contract","description":"The Paima L2 Contract is built for developers to deploy their own game as an L2 which seamlessly works with Paima Engine.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Setting Up Your Environment/deploying-your-stateful-nft":{"id":"home/Setting Up Your Environment/deploying-your-stateful-nft","title":"Deploying Your Own Stateful NFT Contract","description":"Paima Engine supports both classical ERC721 NFT contracts and Paima Extended ERC721 NFT contracts for Stateful NFTs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home/Setting Up Your Environment/environment-config-values":{"id":"home/Setting Up Your Environment/environment-config-values","title":"Environment Configuration Variables","description":"The following is a list of possible environment variables that can be configured for your project.
