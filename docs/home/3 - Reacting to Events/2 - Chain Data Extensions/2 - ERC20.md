# ERC20 CDEs

- [ERC20](#erc20), keeping track of wallet balances for a specified ERC20 contract;
- [ERC20Deposit](#erc20deposit), keeping track of the total amount of a specified ERC20 contract sent by wallets to a 

## ERC20

### Example

```yaml
extensions:
  - name: "Bar"
    type: "erc20"
    contractAddress: "0xFE...11"
    startBlockHeight: 4567123
```

### Meaning

This extension allows you to track the balances of a specified ERC20 token for all wallets by processing `Transfer` events the contract emits.

### Paima Concise format

The ERC20 CDE does not schedule any inputs, so the `scheduledPrefix` field can be omitted.

### Utility functions

- `getFungibleTokenBalance`, to fetch the balance of a specified wallet address:

```ts
export async function getFungibleTokenBalance(
  readonlyDBConn: Pool,
  cdeName: string,
  walletAddress: string
): Promise<bigint | null>;
```

## ERC20Deposit

### Example

```yaml
extensions:
  - name: "Foo"
    type: "erc20-deposit"
    contractAddress: "0xFE...10"
    startBlockHeight: 4567123
    scheduledPrefix: "dp"
    depositAddress: "0xAB...CD"
```

### Meaning

Unlike the ERC20 extension, which keeps track of the overall balances of the specified token, this one only keeps track of transfers made to a _Deposit Address_ specified in the config file. It stores the total amount transferred, and triggers a scheduled input for each such transfer. The desired deposit address needs to be specified in the config file as the `depositAddress` field as seen in the example earlier.

### Paima Concise format

A scheduled input is triggered every time a transfer is made to the deposit address. The scheduled input will have the following format:

```
prefix|fromAddr|value
```

where:

- `prefix` is the `scheduledPrefix` specified in the config file,
- `fromAddr` is the address from which tokens have been sent to the deposit address,
- `value` is the amount transferred in base 10.

### Utility functions

- Fetch the total amount the specified address has deposited to the deposit address

```ts
// total amount the specified address has deposited to the deposit address
export async function totalAmountDeposited(
  readonlyDBConn: Pool,
  cdeName: string,
  walletAddress: string
): Promise<bigint | null>;
```

- Fetch the list of wallet addresses which have sent at least the specified threshold amount

```ts
export async function findUsersWithDepositsGreaterThan(
  readonlyDBConn: Pool,
  cdeName: string,
  thresholdAmount: bigint
): Promise<string[]>;
```
