# Effect on Interfaces

Enabling wallet delegation has implications on the interfaces of multiple different parts of your application.

## Meta Primitive

The user must (using a [concise](../../../200-read-write-L2-state/1-base-format.md) command) send a transaction to delegate their wallet address to another wallet address

Wallet delegation provides the following [meta primitives](../../../300-react-to-events/2-primitive-catalogue/5-meta/100-introduction.md):
```
    delegate            =   &wd|from?|to?|from_signature|to_signature
    migrate             =   &wm|from?|to?|from_signature|to_signature
    cancelDelegations   =   &wc|to?
```

## STF

[STF](../../../200-read-write-L2-state/10-read-data.md#stf-function) data is slightly changed:
* `userAddress`: contains the main wallet address.
* `realAddress`: contains the real wallet address that sent the transaction.
* `userId`: contains the user id, which is the same for all wallets of the same user.

`userAddress` and `realAddress` will be the same for the main wallet or if there are no delegations.

## Indexer Database

There are 2 tables tracked in the indexer to manage delegations:
* `addresses`: *(always present)* maps a unique user id to each wallet address.
* `delegations`: *(new for delegations)* maps delegated wallet addresses using IDs from the *addresses* table.

## Middleware

There are multiple files part of `@paima/sdk/mw-core` to help integrate wallet delegation

### Connect two wallets

This function delegates `from` your main wallet `to` your burner wallet

When delegating, you must sign the following message template in 2 steps: once for each key (`from` key & `to` key):
```
DELEGATE-WALLET:<other-address-lowercase>:<env-contract-address>
```
* The previous plaintext message can be generated with the builtin helper: `WalletConnectHelper.buildMessageToSign(other-address-lowercase)`
* `other-address-lowercase`: the address not signing this step
* `env-contract-address`: is defined in [.env](../../../1-setup/4-environment-config-values.md) (`CONTRACT_ADDRESS`)
* *Note:* the address signing for a given step is not explicitly added since its address & signature are implicitly part of the transaction


```js
function walletConnect(
  // If from/to are null
  // they gets replaced by the wallet that sends (or signs if using the batcher) the tx
  from: string | null,
  to: string | null,
  from_signature: string,
  to_signature: string
): Promise<SuccessfulResult<PostDataResponse> | FailedResult>
```

### Cancel delegation

This function removes any current delegation to the sender address.
If `to` is an empty string, it will remove all delegations.
If `to` is a valid address, it will remove the delegation to that single address.

```js
function walletConnectCancelDelegations(
  to: string
): Promise<SuccessfulResult<PostDataResponse> | FailedResult>
```

### Migrate wallet

This function migrates the address `from` to `to`.

```js
function walletConnectMigrate(
  // null gets replaced by the wallet that signs the tx
  from: string | null,
  to: string | null,
  from_signature: string,
  to_signature: string
): Promise<SuccessfulResult<PostDataResponse> | FailedResult> 
```

### Helper

The `WalletConnectHelper` class contains helper functions to sign with injected or generate the message for local wallets:
1. `buildMessageToSign` to generate the correct concise notation to sign for an action
2. `connectExternalWalletAndSign` to connect an external wallet and delegate from it at the same time.
