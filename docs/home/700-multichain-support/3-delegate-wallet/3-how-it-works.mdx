# How it works


## Wallet Delegate API

The user must send a transaction to delegate their wallet address to another wallet address, through a concise command.
IMPORTANT: This functionally is automatically provided by the SDK helpers.
```
    delegate            =   &wd|from?|to?|from_signature|to_signature
    migrate             =   &wm|from?|to?|from_signature|to_signature
    cancelDelegations   =   &wc|to_signature
```
They must sign the transaction with the following message:
```
DELEGATE-WALLET:<other-address-lowercase>:<env-contract-address>`
```
* from: the main address that will be 
* to 
* other-address-lowercase: is "to" or "from" for "from" and "to" respectively address in lowercase.
* env-contract-address: is defined in .env CONTRACT_ADDRESS

## STF

STF data is slightly changed:
* userAddress: contains the main wallet address.
* realAddress: contains the real wallet address that sent the transaction.
* userId: contains the user id, which is the same for all wallets of the same user.

userAddress and realAddress will be the same for the main wallet or if there are no delegations.

## Wallet Delegate Tables

There will to managed tables
* addresses: maps a unique user id to each wallet address.
* delegations: maps delegated wallet addresses.

## API

1. This function delegates Wallet "to" to "from".
null "from" or "to" gets replace by wallet that sends (or signs if using the batcher) the transaction.
```js
function walletConnect(
  from: string | null,
  to: string | null,
  from_signature: string,
  to_signature: string
): Promise<SuccessfulResult<PostDataResponse> | FailedResult>
```

2. This function removes any current delegation to the sender address.
The message has the format:
```js
DELEGATE-WALLET::<env-contract-address>`;
```

```js
function walletConnectCancelDelegations(
  to_signature: string
): Promise<SuccessfulResult<PostDataResponse> | FailedResult> {
```

3. This function migrates the address "from" to "to".
null "from" or "to" gets replace by wallet that sends (or signs if using the batcher) the transaction.
```js
function walletConnectMigrate(
  from: string | null,
  to: string | null,
  from_signature: string,
  to_signature: string
): Promise<SuccessfulResult<PostDataResponse> | FailedResult> 
```

4. This class contains helper functions to sign with injected or generate the message for local wallets.
```js
class WalletConnectHelper {
    buildMessageToSign(subMessage: string): string;
    connectExternalWalletAndSign(
    walletType: AddressType,
    walletName: string,
    subMessage: string
  ): Promise<{
    message: string;
    signedMessage: string;
    walletAddress: string;
  }>
}
```
