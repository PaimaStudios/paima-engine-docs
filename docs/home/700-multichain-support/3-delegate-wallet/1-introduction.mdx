# Introduction

Delegate Wallet allows for a wallet address to be delegated to another wallet address.

In practice, a user can use wallet address `A` to play, but their real wallet address is `B`

Some use cases:
* **Better UX**: By using a "Local Wallet" within the browser and sending transactions through the "Batcher", so each transaction gets signed automatically.
* **Security**: Allowing players to have a "Burner Wallet" with limited funds to only play.
* **Security**: Reduce interaction with real wallet.
* **Account Recovery**: account can be re-delegated to a new wallet address.
* **Identity Privacy**: real wallet address is not exposed.


This feature is optional, but you can implement at any time.
As good practice use `user_id` in the STF to identify the user, and not the wallet address.
