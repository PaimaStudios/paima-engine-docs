# Mina funnel

## Configuration

The Mina funnel requires access to historical chain data which is acquired
through an [archive
node](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-operators/archive-node). A connection
to the database is required. 

```yaml
Mina:
  type: mina
  archiveConnectionString: "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/archive"
  confirmationDepth: 15
  delay: 3600
```

- `delay` is in seconds.
- `confirmationDepth` is in number of blocks. If not provided then the archive's
node configuration is used (blocks with a chain_status of *canonical*).

## Conceptually

This funnel has the following steps in the readData function:

1. Fetch blocks & timestamps from the underlying funnel. This can be either a
funnel for a single chain, like the [block funnel](300-block-funnel.md), or it
can be a collection of wrapped funnels involving multiple networks.
2. Fetch the latest canonical Mina block timestamp. If `confirmationDepth` has a
value in the configuration, this is done by getting the block at that particular
height. Otherwise this is done by querying the `blocks` table to get the latest
block which has `canonical` status. In this case the block confirmation
parameters are defined by the archive's configuration.
4. Query the database for events and actions in a certain timestamp range. The
upper bound of this timestamp range is defined by the blocks fetched at step 1.
The lower bound is the upper bound on the previous round.
5. Merge the primitives with the underlying funnel.

### Presync

The presync phase finishes after indexing all the blocks with a timestamp
strictly lower than `START_BLOCK_HEIGHT - delay`.  Each primitive is paginated
individually, and progress is tracked in the `cde_tracking_cursor_pagination`
table. The presync finishes when there are no more events in the range for any
of the configured extensions.

## Finalizing blocks

Since events parsed by the state transition are final, we need to be sure that
we have processed all the Mina events that are associated with a certain block
height before supplying those to the state transition. To guarantee this, the
Mina funnel will wait for the timestamp of the latest `canonical` block to be
greater or equal than the timestamp of the target block.  This is necessary
because otherwise there is no guarantee that the needed blocks are already
propagated to the archive node, or in case there is a re-org.

Internally this is done by querying the `blocks` table for the latest block with
a status of `canonical`.

## Indexer Database

This funnel requires no change to the Mina archive node database schema. The following tables are used to
retrieve the necessary information:

- account_identifiers
- accounts_accessed
- blocks
- blocks_zkapp_commands
- zkapp_account_update
- zkapp_account_update_body
- zkapp_commands
- zkapp_events
- zkapp_field
- zkapp_field_array

Usage is similar to the one used in [Archive-Node-Api](https://github.com/o1-labs/Archive-Node-API) except for the following:

- `blocks` are filtered by the `timestamp` column when needed.
- `zkapp_commands` is filtered by `hash` to paginate the results during presync.
- `blocks` is used to find the the latest finalized block, which is not a
use-case supported by Archive-Node-Api.
